**PoC Cloud Vision**

Google Cloud Vision API enables developers to **understand the content of an image** by encapsulating **powerful machine learning models** in an easy to use REST API. It quickly **classifies images** into thousands of categories (e.g., "sailboat", "lion", "Eiffel Tower"), **detects individual objects and faces within images**, and finds and reads printed words contained within images. You can build metadata on your image catalog, moderate offensive content, or enable new marketing scenarios through image sentiment analysis. **Analyze images uploaded in the request** or integrate with your image storage on Google Cloud Storage.

This POC compares OCR and Label recognitions capabilities on Cloud Vision against Microsoft Cognitive Services and Tesseract.
